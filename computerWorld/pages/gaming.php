<!--            <p>Though it may be disguised as an “ordinary” computer akin to what you’d find your parents using, the Dell XPS Tower Special Edition is a master of deception. Inside, you’ll find your choice of one of the latest high-end graphics card solutions from AMD or Nvidia in addition to a powerful Skylake processor paired with 8 gigs of RAM and plenty of storage.It may not have “the look,” but the XPS Tower Special Edition is capable of far more than basic word processing-->
<!---->
<!--                But Dell didn’t stop there. Rather, the computer company managed to squeeze in discrete graphics that, surprisingly for a pre-built machine, doesn’t cost an outrageous wad of cash. Not only that, but register your XPS Tower Special Edition with Dell and they’ll throw in complimentary customer support via the web. If you prefer your PCs with subdued, austere designs over those bedecked with aliens and snakes, this one does it all.-->

<!--            <p>Microsoft doesn’t seem to have a care in the world for what other hardware makers are doing, making the Surface Studio all the more glamorous as a result. It costs quite more than the competing Dell XPS 27 and more than double that of the HP Envy AIO 27, but it’s also a more premium product. Featuring Surface Pen support and 10-point multi-touch, it’s more than a basic productivity and entertainment machine.-->
<!---->
<!--                The 28-inch, 4,500 x 3,000 PixelSense Display puts even most 4K screens to shame, while the fully-articulating stand makes it a rather versatile tool whether it’s for work or play. That goes without mentioning the aluminum finish, which suits the Surface Studio well against the sheen of the Microsoft Windows logo from the rear. Though the port placement is a little funky, the Surface Studio goes above and beyond.</p>-->

A built-in screen, speakers and 802.11ac wireless networking are only complemented by the fantastic Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2. All you need is a single power cable to get it up and running.-->

<!--                The 27-inch, 5K iMac in particular can be configured with a quad-core Intel Core i5 processor touting up to 3.9GHz clock speeds with Turbo Boost kicked into high gear. And, of course, trumpeting that eloquent 5K screen, it looks just as sleek as it feels to use. Plus, even bearing the guts of an entire desktop rig, the aluminum chassis somehow stays slimmer than most standalone monitors.-->

<!--            <p>The Mac mini exhibits the luxury of an Apple desktop without the extravagant price tag to match. Though it ships without the otherwise expected Magic Mouse and Keyboard peripherals, getting to choose your own accessories is, at the very least, liberating. Featuring an aluminum shell and a chassis design that’s both compact and simple, the Mac Mini is Apple at its most quintessential.-->
<!---->
<!--                And, while it hasn't been updated in quite some time on the hardware front, the Mac Mini's Haswell-based i5 processor still chugs along nicely. Plus, with Iris Graphics onboard, you'll get a bit more juice than expected. Combined with 500GB of storage space and 4GB of RAM, the Mac mini is arguably the best starting point for macOS newcomers even if a contemporary makeover is long past due.</p>-->

<!--            <p>The Dell XPS 27 is an all-in-one that does it all, and it does so with pristine equity. Resting atop an articulating stand is a massive 4K Ultra HD touchscreen display and a whopping sextet of ear-numbing speakers. Not only is it attractive, what with its silvery metallic finish and uniquely molded mouse and keyboard, but it’s also top-notch when it comes to delivering powerful specs.-->

<!--                No, there’s no HDMI-in or pressure-sensitive stylus, but that’s because the Dell XPS 27 knows its audience. And that’s, almost strictly, AV junkies and music producers. Whether you’re making your own beats or vibing out to someone else’s; watching films or editing them yourself, the Dell XPS 27 should be at the top of your list when shopping around for a new PC-->

<!--            <p>Asus is a unique hardware maker in that it offers a wide range of computers for every type of user. The Asus VivoMini UN45 specifically is designed for those yearning to keep their desktop in the living room. It may look like an external DVD drive, but this is a full-on desktop that can be used to watch 4K movies, present slideshows or anything else a “regular” desktop can do.-->

<!--                Moreover, the UN45 bears an M.2 SSD regardless of which model you opt for, ranging from 32GB to 128GB. However, if you don’t mind the reduction in performance and configure your VivoMini UN45 with an Intel Celeron N3000, you’ll get the liberty of a fanless design that’s completely silent even when the CPU is under full load</p>-->
