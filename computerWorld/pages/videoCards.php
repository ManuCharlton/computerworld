            <h1>Asus ROG STRIX GTX 1080 O8G GAMING</h1>
            <h1>£659.99, US$869.99</h1>

            <p>For a price premium of one decent game, you get a graphics card that’s far superior to the Founders Edition, both in terms of performance and features.  Thanks to its programmable RGB lighting, it’s especially interesting for those who want to build great-looking systems with windowed side panels. It’s also great for those who would like their PC to remain silent when not in use for gaming.

<!--            <p>Though it may be disguised as an “ordinary” computer akin to what you’d find your parents using, the Dell XPS Tower Special Edition is a master of deception. Inside, you’ll find your choice of one of the latest high-end graphics card solutions from AMD or Nvidia in addition to a powerful Skylake processor paired with 8 gigs of RAM and plenty of storage.It may not have “the look,” but the XPS Tower Special Edition is capable of far more than basic word processing-->

<!--                But Dell didn’t stop there. Rather, the computer company managed to squeeze in discrete graphics that, surprisingly for a pre-built machine, doesn’t cost an outrageous wad of cash. Not only that, but register your XPS Tower Special Edition with Dell and they’ll throw in complimentary customer support via the web. If you prefer your PCs with subdued, austere designs over those bedecked with aliens and snakes, this one does it all.-->

            <h1>£419.99, USUS$569.99</h1><!--HOMEPAGE NAME-->
            <p>At £419.99, the MSI GeForce GTX 1070 Gaming X 8G costs significantly more than the £374.99 you would be paying for a ‘vanilla’ 1070, but it offers much more in terms of both performance and features, and is still some way off the price of a GTX 1080. If you can’t afford a GTX 1080, or would simply like to save some money, this is an excellent high-performance graphics card.

<!--            <p>Microsoft doesn’t seem to have a care in the world for what other hardware makers are doing, making the Surface Studio all the more glamorous as a result. It costs quite more than the competing Dell XPS 27 and more than double that of the HP Envy AIO 27, but it’s also a more premium product. Featuring Surface Pen support and 10-point multi-touch, it’s more than a basic productivity and entertainment machine.-->

<!--                The 28-inch, 4,500 x 3,000 PixelSense Display puts even most 4K screens to shame, while the fully-articulating stand makes it a rather versatile tool whether it’s for work or play. That goes without mentioning the aluminum finish, which suits the Surface Studio well against the sheen of the Microsoft Windows logo from the rear. Though the port placement is a little funky, the Surface Studio goes above and beyond.-->

            <h1>EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Founders Edition</h1>
            <h1>£699.99, US$699</h1>

            <p>The GTX 1080 Ti Founders Edition is expensive, but offers stunning performance. Manufacturer overclocked versions will arrive soon and may be better value, but you can overclock the Founders Edition fairly easily yourself. If you’re not planning to buy a VR headset, you can save money and buy a GTX 1080, but if you can afford it, the 1080 Ti still offers good value and will be more future proof. However, AMD’s Radeon RX Vega cards will be out soon, and it’s worth waiting to see if they’re better value still.</p>

<!--            <p>The iMac keeps it classy and, better yet, simple. Easy-to-use hardware combined with the famed accessibility of macOS makes for a nigh-perfect computing experience. A built-in screen, speakers and 802.11ac wireless networking are only complemented by the fantastic Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2. All you need is a single power cable to get it up and running.-->

<!--                The 27-inch, 5K iMac in particular can be configured with a quad-core Intel Core i5 processor touting up to 3.9GHz clock speeds with Turbo Boost kicked into high gear. And, of course, trumpeting that eloquent 5K screen, it looks just as sleek as it feels to use. Plus, even bearing the guts of an entire desktop rig, the aluminum chassis somehow stays slimmer than most standalone monitors.-->

            <p>One of the best options for upgrading an ageing PC, the Zotac GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB OC Edition delivers some of the fastest frame rates you can achieve from a low-end PC. It costs a little more than a Radeon RX 460, but we feel the performance gains are worth it.</p>

<!--            <p>When it comes to 21.5-inch screens, 4K is more than enough, and that’s exactly what Apple has exemplified with this charming rendition of the iMac. This Intel Skylake-powered beast houses a Retina 4K display that's packed with vibrant colors and that classic aluminum finish Mac lovers can’t live without – plus, it hardly takes up any desk space, leaving plenty of room for trinkets and accessories.-->

            <p>The Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Founders Edition is an excellent high-performance buy - but only if you don’t compare it against another GTX 1080. It isn’t likely to be the best choice if you care about value for money or if you would prefer at least some level of assistance overclocking the card to achieve best performance.</p>

<!--            <p>The Mac mini exhibits the luxury of an Apple desktop without the extravagant price tag to match. Though it ships without the otherwise expected Magic Mouse and Keyboard peripherals, getting to choose your own accessories is, at the very least, liberating. Featuring an aluminum shell and a chassis design that’s both compact and simple, the Mac Mini is Apple at its most quintessential.-->
<!---->
<!--                And, while it hasn't been updated in quite some time on the hardware front, the Mac Mini's Haswell-based i5 processor still chugs along nicely. Plus, with Iris Graphics onboard, you'll get a bit more juice than expected. Combined with 500GB of storage space and 4GB of RAM, the Mac mini is arguably the best starting point for macOS newcomers even if a contemporary makeover is long past due.-->
